* focus is __Android__ target. So in that case ensure that you installed android sdk. this will provide an android emulator which you can use to run your flutter app.
* you will find your dart code in `lib/` folder
* think in widgets in flutter. everything is a widget. you want an app? then create a class which inherit the widgets class.
* in flutter you mainly work with stateless (immutable, properties are final) and stateful widgets.
